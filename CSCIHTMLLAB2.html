			<h2><i>Why did I take Computer Science?</i></h2>
			<p>As I mentioned before in my <i>major page</i>, I went into this second year of college without really an idea of what I wanted to do.<br />
			Since taking this class, I've reignited an old passion, and possible career choice; <b>coding.</b><br/>
			When I was around 12 years old, I taught myself how to code in LUA, the coding language of a gaming platform called <i>Roblox.</i><br /></p>

			<br />
			<p>Since taking this computer science class (taught by Tom Stokke), I've remembered how fun coding and working with computers really is!<br/>
			I'm finally enjoying something school-related, and it's becoming a passion of mine.</p>

			<p>So far, some of the work has been a little challenging, but nothing I can't figure out if I put my mind to it.<br />
			The classwork is (for the most part) fun, and the lectures are entertaining! It's always nice watching a lecture when<br />
			a teacher can crack a few jokes and seem relatable with the class. Overall, I'm happy I took it!</p>
