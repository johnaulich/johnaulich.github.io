	<h3>Although I enjoy <i>many</i> different activities, I have <b>two</b> main favorite ways to spend my free time:<br />
	Playing <i>basketball</i> and <i>bodybuilding/weightlifting.</i></h3>
	</br>
	<p>I've played basketball since I was in <u>seventh</u> grade, and have grown to love the sport more and more since then.
	<br /><b>Now</b>, I don't play organized games, but I still enjoy playing pick-up games at the gym or outside.</p>

	<p id="c1"><i>Figure 6 </i>(One of my favorite players to watch: <b>Lebron James)</b></p> 
	<p id="c2"><i>Figure 7 </i>(Pictured here is</i> <b>World's Strongest Man</b> Brian Shaw)</i></p>
	<br />
	<p>My interests have broadened to now including <b>strongman, powerlifting,</b> and <b>bodybuilding.</b> I love the three of these equally,
	<br />
	but I focus on <b>bodybuilding/powerlifting</b> the most because I don't have good enough genetics for strongman.
	<br/>
	Whether I'm in the gym working towards a possible future competition, or watching videos on youtube, weight-lifting has
	<br />
	become a huge part of my life.</p>
	<p>Since I've been out of high school, I've been playing less basketball and engaging in more activities in the weight room.</p>
